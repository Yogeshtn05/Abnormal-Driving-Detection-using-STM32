# STM32 Project for Abnormal Driving Detection

In this project, I collected data from the MPU6050 sensor for detecting abnormality in driving, such as sudden changes in the direction of the vehicle and shaking due to rough road conditions.

I developed an Edge AI N-Class model using NanoEdge AI Studio from the data collected from the MPU6050 sensor using the STM32 L432KC board.

I deployed the N-Class model in the STM32 L432KC, interfaced with the MPU6050, for live tracking of abnormal driving conditions and alerting using the LED on the board.

From this project, I learned:
- Collection of raw data from the MPU6050 sensor  
- Processing the data for creating an AI model  
- Deploying the model in the STM32 L432KC
